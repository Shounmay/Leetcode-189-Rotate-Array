<h2> <u>Problem Link:</u> https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/ </h2>

<h1 ><u> Idea Used: </u></h1>

## Using Reversal Algorithm of rotation it's solved. Divide the array at a point where the index is of last kth element. Reverse both parts. Then reverse the whole array. Overall we are not taking any space and traversal takes O(N) Time.

<h1 ><u> Time and Space Analysis </u></h1>

## Time-Complexity: O(N)

## Space-Compexity: O(1)
